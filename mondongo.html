                        In a large pot combine the tripe, baking soda, and enough 
                        water to cover the tripe by 2 inches.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and cook until the tripe 
                        is very tender, about 1 to 2 hours or 45 minutes if using a
                        pressure cooker. Drain the tripe and discard the water.</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, place the cooked tripe, pork meat, chorizos, 
                        tomato, scallions, onion, garlic, cumin and achiote. 
                        Add enough water to cover.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and simmer 
                        slowly. For about 45 minutes. Add the yuca, cilantro and 
                        potatoes. Cook for 30 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Ladle into bowls, and garnish with additional fresh cilantro 
                        and lime wedges. Serve with white rice, avocado, 
                        banana and hot sauce (aj√≠) on the side.</li>
