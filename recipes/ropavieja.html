                    <li>2 cups cooked Canilla Extra Long Grain Rice</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. 
                        Season meat with Adobo. Add steak to pot and cook in batches, 
                        flipping once, until well browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer 
                        meat to a plate. Lower heat to medium. Stir in onions and 
                        peppers. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are 
                        soft, about 10 minutes. Add sofrito and garlic to pot; 
                        cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

                    </li>
                    <li>Stir in 3 cups of water, tomato sauce, Sazon, 
                        beef bouillon and pepper. Bring mixture to a boil. 
                        Return beef to pot. Lower heat to medium low and simmer, 
                        covered, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. 
                        Stir in olives and capers. Cover pot; simmer until meat shreds
                        easily with fork, 1 - 1 1/2 hours, adding more water in 1/4 
                        cup measurements, if pot becomes dry. Transfer meat to work 
                        surface; shred meat with two forks. Bring remaining sauce to 
                        a boil. Mix meat and cilantro into sauce. 
                        Serve with white rice.
